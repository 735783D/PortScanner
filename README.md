# PortScanner

This is just a little portscanner project that was done by following along with the tutorial
from HackerSpoloit at the video in this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3D8PAZV51g).

It is just a proof of concept. I originally tested it on the home address of my computer which yielded all results closed.
I then tested it on the hackthissite.org ipv4 address to get results.
